This is a Facebook Messenger bot that helps students connect to the Wi-Fi.

This is based on sguarav's fb-messenger-bot, which can be found here. This is pretty awesome!

The FSM created here is written by me (OhmGeek), along with the internet instructions. 


# How to use
You will need to register a page with Facebook developer, and then create an app and find/generate all the webhook details necessary. You then need to create a new folder called config, with a file in called 'default.json' which contains all the details. I will add an example one soon.

I hope you enjoy :)
